The Essay (autograde) question type for Moodle >= 3.0
============================================

The essay (autograde) question type allows an essay question response to be given
a preliminary grade that is generated automatically based on one or more of the
following characteristics of the response.

    * the number of words in the response

    * the number of characters in the response

    * the presence of one or more target phrases in the response

    * the presence of common errors in the response

The automatic grade can be overridden by the teacher later.

Additionally, the teacher can set up grading bands that offer a non-linear grading
scheme. In such a scheme, the grade awarded is that of the grading band in which
the word/character count falls.
